# Find-My-Colleague-
This Android application was built in a team of three at BRACathon 2015. It was under the problem statement "Find My Colleague".
Here, users can find fellow colleagues when they are out of reach. It is not an application to track an employee but an approach
to find them when required. In this application, users decide what to share with other colleagues.
